 <h2> Reaching the Feder lab </h2>

We're located in S103 in the south half of the <a href =
"https://goo.gl/maps/Kd1aR2dKccoWk2q56" class = "minlink">Foege building</a>,
opposite from Bioengineering. The lab space is restricted access, so here are
a few instructions that help me figure out where to meet you.<br><br>

There are multiple entrances to the building, but the easiest place to
enter is the main entrance under the skybridge shown in the red arrow here:<br>

If you have a Husky Card, you should be able to get through the main
door. Just to the right of the door when you
enter, you should see a few chairs and a table, which is a good place
to wait: <br><br>

If you don't have a Husky Card, I'll plan to meet you outside the main
door.
